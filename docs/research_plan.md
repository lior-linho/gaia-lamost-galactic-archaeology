# Research Plan

## Umbrella Direction

This repository is an umbrella research-oriented project on **data-driven Galactic archaeology** using Gaia DR3 and LAMOST.

The project is not designed as a single isolated notebook. Instead, it is organized as a connected research line with three sub-projects, moving from data construction to exploratory discovery and then to interpretable candidate selection.

The current focus is to build a reproducible scientific workflow for combining large-scale astronomical survey data, constructing physically meaningful features, and exploring stellar population structures.

## Research Line

### Project I: Gaia–LAMOST Cross-matching and Chemo-kinematic Feature Construction

**Goal:**  
Build a clean Gaia–LAMOST cross-matched sample and construct physically meaningful features for later stellar population analysis.

**Main questions:**

- How can Gaia DR3 astrometry and LAMOST spectroscopy be combined into a clean analysis-ready sample?
- What quality checks are needed for cross-matched sources?
- Which astrometric, kinematic, chemical, and stellar-parameter features are useful for downstream analysis?

**Expected outputs:**

- Gaia DR3 sample validation
- LAMOST catalogue exploration
- Gaia–LAMOST cross-matched sample
- Chemo-kinematic feature table
- Basic validation figures

### Project II: Unsupervised Stellar Population Discovery

**Goal:**  
Use visualization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering methods to explore possible stellar population structures in the Gaia–LAMOST feature space.

**Main questions:**

- Can exploratory visualization reveal separations between different stellar populations?
- How do metallicity, motion, and stellar parameters relate to disk-like or halo-like populations?
- Can unsupervised learning methods reveal meaningful structures without predefined labels?

**Expected outputs:**

- Color-magnitude and chemo-kinematic visualizations
- Feature-space projections
- Clustering experiments
- Initial interpretation of possible stellar population groups

---

### Project III: Interpretable Machine Learning for Galactic Substructure Candidates

**Goal:**  
Develop interpretable machine learning workflows for identifying and analyzing candidate Galactic substructures.

**Main questions:**

- Can candidate stellar groups be selected using interpretable feature-based models?
- Which features contribute most strongly to possible population separation?
- How can machine learning outputs be connected back to astrophysical interpretation?

**Expected outputs:**

- Candidate selection workflow
- Interpretable model experiments
- Feature importance or explanation analysis
- Research-style discussion of limitations and future work

## Planned Milestones

### Milestone 1: Gaia DR3 Query and Validation

Query Gaia DR3 stellar samples and validate the basic astrometric and photometric fields.

### Milestone 2: LAMOST Catalogue Exploration and Cross-match

Explore LAMOST spectroscopic fields and cross-match LAMOST sources with Gaia DR3 sources.

### Milestone 3: Chemo-kinematic Feature Construction

Construct distance, velocity, metallicity, and stellar-parameter features for later analysis.

### Milestone 4: Exploratory Visualization

Visualize the sample using color-magnitude diagrams, distance distributions, velocity features, and metallicity trends.

### Milestone 5: Machine Learning Exploration

Apply exploratory methods such as dimensionality reduction and clustering to search for stellar population structures.

### Milestone 6: Research-style Report

Summarize the data, methods, figures, limitations, and possible interpretations in a research-style report.

## Expected Outcome

The expected outcome is a reproducible undergraduate-level research portfolio project with clean documentation, visual outputs, reusable code, and a written report.

The project is designed as a foundation for future research opportunities in physics, astronomy, scientific computing, or data-driven science.

## Project 2: Machine-learning Assisted Stellar Population Clustering

Project 2 extends Project 1 from exploratory candidate diagnostics toward unsupervised stellar population clustering.

### Scientific Aim

The scientific aim is to test whether Gaia–LAMOST chemo-kinematic feature spaces contain interpretable stellar population structure that can be recovered using unsupervised machine-learning methods.

### Primary Input Dataset

The primary input dataset is:

- `data/processed/gaia_lamost_larger_velocity_features.csv`

This table is selected because it combines:

- Gaia astrometry and photometry
- LAMOST stellar parameters and radial velocity
- derived photometric and tangential-velocity features
- Galactic coordinates
- Galactocentric position and velocity features
- Project 1 candidate flags for later interpretation

### Research Question

Can unsupervised machine learning recover interpretable stellar population structure from Gaia–LAMOST chemo-kinematic features?

### Working Hypothesis

A combined chemo-kinematic feature space may separate disk-like stars, metal-poor or high-velocity candidates, and possible dynamically distinct objects more clearly than photometric or chemical features alone.

### Methodological Principle

Project 1 candidate flags should not be used as clustering labels. They should be reserved for post-hoc interpretation of clusters or outliers.

### Planned Feature Spaces

- photometric-astrometric feature space
- chemical and stellar-parameter feature space
- local kinematic feature space
- Galactocentric velocity feature space
- combined chemo-kinematic feature space

### Planned Methods

- StandardScaler or RobustScaler
- PCA
- UMAP
- DBSCAN or HDBSCAN
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- cluster interpretation using CMD, metallicity, velocity, and candidate-score diagnostics

### Scientific Caution

Any clusters found in Project 2 should be interpreted as exploratory structures in feature space, not as confirmed stellar streams, merger debris, or new Galactic substructures without further validation.
