## Major Scientific Results So Far

### Project II — Orbital Dynamics

Project II has produced a full baseline dynamical layer for the 27-candidate sample.

Key results:

- 27 / 27 candidates are ready for baseline orbit integration.
- 27 / 27 candidates were successfully integrated with `galpy`.
- 16 candidates have eccentricity >= 0.7.
- 16 candidates have Zmax >= 3 kpc.
- 24 candidates are inner-halo-like by the current baseline orbit proxy.
- 0 candidates are disk-confined by the current orbit proxy.
- Orbit-angular-momentum consistency analysis found:
  - 24 consistent candidates
  - 3 partially consistent candidates
  - 0 obvious tension cases

Interpretation:

The candidate sample is strongly dominated by dynamically hot, halo-like, radial, retrograde, or high-inclination behavior rather than ordinary disk-confined orbits.

---

### Project III — Stellar Population Analysis

Project III has produced first-pass population labels and a priority review.

Population-group counts:

- Retrograde halo: 15
- Radial halo or GSE-like: 4
- Prograde hot or heated-disk: 3
- Retrograde uncertain: 3
- High-inclination halo: 1
- General halo: 1

Population-confidence counts:

- Moderate: 24
- Limited: 3

Priority-tier counts after stricter review:

- Priority A: 6
- Priority B: 14
- Priority C: 4
- Review only: 3

Interpretation:

The population analysis suggests that the sample is dominated by halo-like and dynamically hot populations, with especially important retrograde and radial candidates for later literature comparison.

---

### Project IV — Metallicity Structure and Chemical Readiness

Project IV currently uses [Fe/H] only.

Metallicity-class counts:

- Very metal-poor: 2
- Metal-poor: 3
- Moderately metal-poor: 8
- Metal-intermediate: 14

Chemical follow-up priority counts:

- Chemical Priority A: 5
- Chemical Priority B: 9
- Chemical Priority C: 6
- Chemical review only: 7

Interpretation:

The available [Fe/H] information already supports a useful metallicity-readiness layer, but full chemical tagging is not yet possible because alpha, Mg, Ca, and Si abundance columns are not currently integrated.

---

### Project VI — Scientific Validation

Project VI has produced the first uncertainty inventory and validation roadmap.

Validation-priority counts:

- Validation Priority A: 2
- Validation Priority B: 9
- Validation Priority C: 9
- Validation review only: 7

Validation-risk counts:

- Lower validation risk: 24
- High validation risk: 3

Interpretation:

The strongest candidates are already scientifically interesting, but final claims require Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation, potential-model sensitivity tests, and literature-region comparison.

## Current Limitations

The current research program is scientifically structured but still has important limitations:

1. The orbit integration uses a single baseline Milky Way potential.
2. Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation has not yet been applied.
3. Distance uncertainty remains a major limitation.
4. Literature-defined merger-remnant regions have not yet been applied.
5. Chemical information is currently limited to [Fe/H].
6. Alpha, Mg, Ca, Si, and other abundance dimensions are not yet integrated.
7. Some notebooks are currently result-review notebooks and should later be upgraded into fuller executable research notebooks.
8. Repository terminology still needs a final consistency polish to remove old milestone and Project 1/2/3 wording.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

The next research steps are:

1. Project VI small-scale Monte Carlo prototype on Priority A candidates.
2. Literature comparison preparation for Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Sequoia, Helmi Stream, Nyx, and Splash.
3. Search original LAMOST data products for additional abundance columns.
4. Add Energy-Lz and action-space diagnostics.
5. Prepare a repository-wide consistency polish pass.
6. Begin manuscript-structure planning after validation improves.

## Current Overall Assessment

The project has reached a strong first integrated research-program state.

It now contains:

- A reproducible data foundation
- Computational-discovery evidence
- Angular-momentum diagnostics
- Baseline galpy orbit integration
- Internal dynamical consistency validation
- Initial stellar-population classification
- Metallicity-readiness analysis
- Scientific-validation roadmap

The next major scientific upgrade should focus on uncertainty propagation and literature comparison.
